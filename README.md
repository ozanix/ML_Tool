# ML_Tool
Here you will find a set of tools that you can use to develop your own image classification machine learning models. The tool can be run on a browser (Chrome is recommended). It does not require any programming skills. The purpose of this project is to provide an AI application development tool for researchers or practitioners who do not have programming skills or do not have time to delve into the technical details of the most of the ML development platforms.
This tool has three main elements:
1. Image Set Preperation Tool: A tool that combines the images that you will use to train the model. It creates a single file that combines all the images you selected.
2. ML Model Generator: A tool to generate an ML model. You enter the output of tool#1 above and adjust the other parameters. This tool outputs an ML model.
3. Tool to run ML Models: A tool to run your ML model. This tool allows you to run your ML model and get a model prediction as the output.

The three tools (1,2,3) outlined above can be used independently. If you are starting from scratch, you must use the tools in the order they are presented above (1,2,3).
